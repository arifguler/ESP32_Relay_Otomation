Hello guys,
This is a circuit board that can contain 32 relays.
If the relays you install are of good quality, you can drive strong loads (I use it for lighting)
The drawings were made with KiCad 5.1.6, you can edit as you wish.
AdafruitMCP23017, ESP32Wifi and Blynk libraries were used for the software.
